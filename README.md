# NoticeMe
Standardized NOTICE.md for open source developers.

Frequently as open source developers we find ourselves bound by the requirements of a license to attribute or include notice in some form.
This project is an attempt at a standardized way of relaying human and machine readable license attribution and/or notice.

## Using NoticeMe
The recommended way of using NoticeMe as of v2.0.0 is to include applicable license identifiers in `NOTICE.md` as second-level headings.

e.g. `## SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`

Then attribution(s) at the third-level headings with the requisite text at the level of the applicable attribution.
e.g. 

```

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.
